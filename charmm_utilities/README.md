Scripts for manipulating CHARMM parameter files
================================

These scripts are *UNSUPPORTED* and *UNOFFICIAL*. They may or may not work for you. There is NO WARRANTY of any kind. It is indeed quite possible that manipulated parameter files introduce errors in your simulations.

They are mostly useful for people using the results of the excellent ParamChem service for parametrizing ligands (and the corresponding CGenFF forcefield) outside of the official CHARMM software.


Split stream
------------

This hack parses a __ligand.str__ stream file generated by ParamChem and splits it into the corresponding topology section (usually named __top_ligand.rtf), useful for building the system, and parameter section (__par_ligand.prm__), necessary for simulation.

Example usage:
__split_stream.pl ligand.str__

Note that the operation is error-prone and depends on the version of ParamChem used (tested as of Oct-2013). Some errors are detected and marked on output.



Combine parameters
------------------

This hack combines various sections of several CHARMM-style parameter files. The most common use case is to merge a parameter file extracted from a ParamChem-generated stream into a pre-merged "catch-all" parameter file.

The _all-parameters_ directory provides two such files, analogous of those found in VMD, created from (a) the official CHARMM36 forcefield distribution __toppar_c36_aug12.tgz__ (available at http://mackerell.umaryland.edu/CHARMM_ff_params.html) and (b) Charmm22* parameters from http://home.uchicago.edu/~/kippjohnson/par_all22star_prot_revision-one.inp .

Example usage:
__combine_parameters.pl par_all36_prot22_na_lipid_carb_ethers_cgenff_water_ions.prm par_warfarin.prm >parameters__


*Important*  The result MAY BE WRONG.  You should be doing this by hand. This script only provides a draft.  POSITIVELY DO NOT TRUST the resulting parameter file.  NBFIX, cutoffs, and many other parts are corrupted, and syntax errors are introduced. Triple-check! You should only rely on official software and your knowledge, not this script, to merge parameter files.
